# Peachpie.Avalonia

Peachpie.Avalonia is a project that combines the power of the Peachpie compiler with the Avalonia UI framework. It allows developers to write cross-platform desktop applications using C# and .NET, targeting multiple platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Features

- **Cross-platform development:** Write once, run anywhere. With Peachpie.Avalonia, you can build applications that can be deployed on different operating systems without the need for platform-specific code.

- **Full access to Avalonia:** Leverage the capabilities of the Avalonia UI framework, which provides a rich set of controls and components for building modern, responsive desktop applications.

- **Performance:** Benefit from the performance optimizations provided by the Peachpie compiler, which compiles your C# code into efficient native binaries.

- **Interop with PHP:** Peachpie is a PHP compiler and runtime for .NET, allowing you to seamlessly interop between C# and PHP code. This opens up possibilities for integrating existing PHP codebases or leveraging PHP libraries in your Avalonia applications.
